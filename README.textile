h1. mongoDB.prefpane

Don't you love mongoDB. Don't you hate it literally drains your memory?

Well, mongoDB prefpane is a simple shortcut to start/stop the mongoDB daemon.

h2. Installation

* Clone the source and compile the source, then run the .prefpane generated.
* Download the compressed binary version from the downloads page

h2. Updating

It currently doesn't track updates with Sparkle, so you will need to come back later and download new versions.

h2. Configuration

It currently runs the mongod binary, the default path for it is "/usr/local/bin/mongod". If you want to change this, edit in DaemonController.h: #define MONGOD_LOCATION @"/usr/local/bin/mongod", and set your location. i.e: #define MONGOD_LOCATION @"/opt/bin/mongod"

If you need to set extra parameters to run mongod, then edit the Arguments textbox from the pane.

h2. Known Issues

It crashes System Preferences when re/installing the .prefpane.

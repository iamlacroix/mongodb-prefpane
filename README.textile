Don't you love mongoDB. Don't you hate it literally drains your memory?

Well, mongoDB prefpane is a simple shortcut to start/stop the mongoDB daemon.

h2. Installation

* Clone the source and compile the source, then run the .prefpane generated.
* Download the compressed binary version from the downloads page

h2. Updating

It currently doesn't track updates with Sparkle, so you will need to come back later and download new versions.

Basically it currently just works if you have your org.mongodb.mongod.plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents

h2. Known Issues

It crashes System Preferences when re/installing the .prefpane.
